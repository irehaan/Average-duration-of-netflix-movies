# Average-duration-of-netflix-movies
This project involved investigating the average duration of movies on Netflix and determining if there was a trend of increasing or declining duration over time. To accomplish this task, the first step was to gather data on the duration of all movies available on Netflix over a specific period of time. Once this data was collected, it was analyzed to determine the average duration of movies and to identify any trends or patterns over time. Statistical methods such as regression analysis were used to determine if there was a significant change in movie duration over time. The results of this analysis would provide insights into the trends in movie duration on Netflix, which could be useful for the development of new content or the optimization of existing content.
